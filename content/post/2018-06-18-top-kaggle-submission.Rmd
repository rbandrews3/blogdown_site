My top submission to Kaggle is a score of 0.605. To get this score, I considered a variety of factors and tested out different models. I first ran a basic GLM model using a variety of variables. After printing out the results, I was able to pick the variables that were most important. After I had these chosen, I used caret to test out multiple models and see which had the most accurate results. I ran a GLM, neural network and a random forest with bootstrapping as my resampling method. In the end, I determined that the GLM was the best choice.
