<p>For project 2, my partner and I made a package in R that converts standard units to metric units. We got the idea in class when Andrew mentioned height in centimeters, and the class didnâ€™t know the conversion. Our program takes in two parameters: a character referring to which conversion to do and the measurement to be converted. The three conversions it does are: feet to meters, pounds to kilograms, and Fahrenheit to Celsius.</p>
